      "question": "Please demonstrate how you confirm and prepare for the provision of individualised personal support in accordance with a person’s individualised support plan. Begin by referring to the support plan to confirm the services to be provided and consult with the person receiving support, their family, carer or others they nominate to identify any specific physical, sensory or cultural needs or preferences. Discuss and confirm the person’s preferences for how support is provided and their preferred level of participation, ensuring your communication is respectful, inclusive and trust-building. Collaborate with the person to agree on actions and activities that align with their plan and promote their independence and right to make informed decisions. Confirm and assemble all required equipment, aids and processes based on the support plan, the person’s preferences and organisational policies and procedures. If any part of the required support is beyond your role, clearly recognise this and seek assistance from your supervisor. Your demonstration must include three separate occasions of providing personal support using aids and equipment (including those used by the person), covering each of the following tasks: dressing, undressing and grooming; eating and drinking using required mealtime techniques and equipment (ensuring the person has physical access); oral hygiene; showering; toileting and the use of continence aids; using slide sheets, hoists, slings and lifters; transferring a person between bed and chair; and transferring a person from seated to standing. While performing each task, you must confirm support preferences and requirements with the person and their support network, perform a risk assessment and seek additional assistance where needed, and prepare all necessary aids, appliances and equipment according to the individualised plan. You must monitor the support provided in collaboration with the person, confirm any changes in requirements, and report or refer according to organisational policy. You are also expected to complete all required documentation and reporting in line with organisational procedures. In your demonstration, you must show knowledge of the rationale and processes underpinning individualised support planning and delivery, including the basic principles of person-centred practice, strengths-based practice and active support. Your approach must reflect principles of respectful behaviour and clearly maintain appropriate work role boundaries, responsibilities and limitations. You must apply relevant legal and ethical requirements in both individual practice and organisational contexts, including those related to privacy, confidentiality and disclosure, duty of care, dignity of risk, human rights, discrimination and mandatory reporting. Additionally, your actions must comply with organisational policies and procedures for privacy, confidentiality of personal information, infection control, referrals, and assembly of equipment, aids and appliances. You must also demonstrate understanding of the roles and responsibilities of the person being supported, their family and carer, health professionals, support workers and supervisors, and how communication occurs between them. Your performance should reflect an awareness of the factors that affect people requiring support and align with service delivery models used in the relevant sector.",
